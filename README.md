# Pairs Trading Strategy Design & Back test 
## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and implementation of a pairs trading strategy. The strategy leverages the statistical relationship between two assets to exploit mean-reverting behavior, identifying trading opportunities when the price spread between the assets deviates from its historical mean. The analysis involves:

 ### Statistical Tests for Cointegration:
   To determine if the asset prices are cointegrated.
 ### Signal Generation: 
   To create trading signals based on the statistical relationship.
 ### Backtesting:
   To evaluate the strategy's performance on historical data.
 ### Performance Metrics: 
   To assess profitability, risk, and the stability of the strategy.

## Generate Sample Dataset
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(10000)
prices = pd.Series(data).cumsum()
train_data, test_data = split_train_test(prices)
pnl, drawdown, sharpe_ratio = backtest_strategy(train_data, train_data)

## Usage
### Import Libraries:
   Ensure all necessary libraries are imported.
### Run Analysis:
   Execute the provided script to perform regression, cointegration tests, signal generation, and backtesting.
### Visualize Results:
Use the provided plotting functions to visualize the strategy's performance.

## Analysis
The backtesting results include:

### Sharpe Ratio: 
   Indicates the risk-adjusted return of the strategy.
### LR Test for Breakout: 
  Determines if there's a significant structural break in the cointegration relationship.

## Future Work
1. Enhance the strategy by incorporating transaction costs and slippage.
2. Apply additional statistical tests for robustness.
3. Optimize parameters for improved performance.
4. Explore machine learning models to predict trading signals.
